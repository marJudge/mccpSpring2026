In academic writing, we learn from published articles or textual mentors by analyzing their structures and recognize patterns that may be re-used. There are some patterns such as CARS model which has been well established and the concepts of moves and steps that guide us to think about how to organize our own writing. 

We'd like to develop an AI-assisted workflow that could help us organize our own manuscripts more effectively. 

The starting point is a collection of papers published in a research student's area. 

We then annotate one paper and identify patterns on organization at both macro and micro levels. It is hoped that we gain some insights from this one paper that would be useful for our own writing. We send this annotated paper to AI and ask AI to learn from our analysis and write a document to describe our analytical approaches and strategies. 

We then send AI 10 or more papers to do similar analyses. It is hoped that with automated analyses of more papers, we can gain more insights.
