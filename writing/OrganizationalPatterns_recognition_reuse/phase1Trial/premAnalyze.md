I've got some papers from LK PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/paper for organizational patterns

these are 5 PDFs
there were two papers from her before
PhDagentSpring2026/literature/LK*/paper1_3705328_3748167.html
PhDagentSpring2026/literature/LK*/paper2_3726302_3729893.html

we'll need to turn them into machine readable format

got one here /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/GTD/Areas/Teaching/Courses/MCCP 6020/PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/paper for organizational patterns/enzo.md
which I just copy manually from https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3705328.3748053

maybe I should simply annotate this paper a bit

PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/paper for organizational patterns/enzo.md

I read the Intro section 
there are some clearly marked (labelled) moves and steps in line with CARS model 
like identify a well known challenge in the field (claim it centrality or importance)
talk about a gap in the literature 

I am not sure what a research student in this area would need in terms of orgnanizing a paper's introduction section 

for me the key is to explain the novelty and contribution of the study in the context of the current problem and existing solutions 

perhaps AI can generate structureIntroEnzo.md to describe how the authors introduce their work and highlight novelty and contribution in a table with some notes on how future authors might learn 

I haven't done any annotation but I could review this note and add some comments
