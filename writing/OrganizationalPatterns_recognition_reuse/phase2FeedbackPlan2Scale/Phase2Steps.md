the analysis on one paper has been done on PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/paper for organizational patterns/enzo.md
here is the annotation file PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/annotateEnzoEnhanced.md

we can scale up and ask AI to analyze more papers based on the examples and PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase1Trial/simonAnnotateApproaches.md

yet, it is not clear how such automated analyses could add more value 

so we need to explore a bit more here and seek comments from the student - the end users of the analysis 

so we should create two new files in PhDagentSpring2026/writing/OrganizationalPatterns_recognition_reuse/phase2FeedbackPlan2Scale

whyhowScaleUpAnalysis.md - here explore and explain why we should scale up the analysis and how to do it with AI
StudentFeedback.md - here raise a few questions inviting students to review the analysis done so far and provide feedback e.g. how they would analyze the paper and what insights they need
