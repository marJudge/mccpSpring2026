based on feedback and discussion so far 
if we plan to scale up an analysis, we should set up a simpler approach mainly focus on general patterns 
also we can take a more targeted approach 
we prepare a menu for a student to choose from 
then we do an automated analysis of 10-20 paper focusing on a specific aspect 
e.g. how to explain novelty of a study; how to plant ideas that help introduce the present study 

create a simplifiedTargetedApproach4Scale.md to describe the new plan based on discussion so far
