# Student Feedback: Reviewing the Organizational-Pattern Analysis

We have completed a detailed analysis of one paper’s introduction (Enzo: *A Language Model-Based Playlist Generation Recommender System*) to identify **organizational patterns** — how the authors establish territory, indicate a gap, and occupy the niche. The goal is to help you recognize and reuse these patterns when writing your own introductions.

Before we scale this analysis to more papers (possibly with AI support), we would like your feedback as **end users** of the analysis. Your answers will help us decide what format and depth of analysis is most useful for you.

## Materials to Review (Optional but Helpful)

- **Paper introduction (analyzed):** `phase1Trial/paper for organizational patterns/enzo.md`
- **Enhanced annotation:** `phase1Trial/annotateEnzoEnhanced.md` — paragraph-by-paragraph analysis with moves, steps, “approaches in play,” and actionable insights for writers.
- **Approach document:** `phase1Trial/simonAnnotateApproaches.md` — the set of analytical approaches (e.g. general-to-specific, A-then-B, planting ideas, gap as mismatch) used to produce the annotation.

You do not need to read everything in detail; even brief answers based on a quick look are valuable.

## Questions for You

### 1. How would *you* analyze this introduction?

If you were asked to explain how the Enzo introduction is structured (e.g. to a fellow student or to yourself when drafting your own paper):

- What would you focus on first? (e.g. overall flow, gap statement, use of citations, clarity of the contribution?)
- Would you use a framework like “establish territory → establish niche → occupy niche,” or something else?
- Is there anything in the **annotateEnzoEnhanced** analysis that you would do differently or would add?

*Your answer helps us see whether the current analysis matches how you naturally think about introductions.*

---

### 2. What insights do you need most when writing your own introduction?

When you sit down to write or revise your paper’s introduction, what would help you the most?

- **Actionable tips** (e.g. “open with general-to-specific,” “state the gap as need vs. solution mismatch”)?
- **Full worked examples** (one or two papers annotated in depth, like Enzo)?
- **Comparison across papers** (e.g. “Paper A does X here; Paper B does Y”)?
- **Feedback on your draft** (e.g. “your paragraph 3 doesn’t yet plant the idea that appears in paragraph 5”)?
- Something else?

*Your answer helps us decide what to produce when we scale up: more papers with the same depth, or more papers with lighter annotation, or a different format (e.g. comparison table, checklist only).*

---

### 3. If we analyzed more papers in the same way as Enzo, would that be useful?

Imagine we had 5–10 papers from your area (e.g. recommender systems, or your thesis subfield), each with an annotation similar to `annotateEnzoEnhanced.md` (moves, steps, approaches, actionable insights).

- Would you read them? All of them, or only a few?
- Would you prefer **one deep example** (like Enzo) or **several shorter annotations** (e.g. one paragraph of analysis per paper)?
- Would such analyses be more useful for **learning** (before you write) or for **revising** (after you have a draft)?

*Your answer helps us understand whether scaling up the analysis is worth the effort and in what form.*

---

### 4. Anything missing or confusing?

- Is there anything in the current Enzo annotation that you find unclear, too dense, or not relevant to your writing?
- Is there a type of insight or pattern you wish we had included but didn’t?

*Your answer helps us improve the analysis format and content for future papers and for your cohort.*
