This unit of rhetorical analysis is used as one of the main organising sub-categories of the Academic Phrasebank. Swales not only identified commonly-used moves in article introductions, but he was interested in showing the kind of language which was used to achieve the communicative purpose of each move. Much of this language was phraseological in nature. The resource also draws upon psycholinguistic insights into how language is learnt and produced. It is now accepted that much of the language we use is phraseological in nature; that it is acquired, stored and retrieved as pre-formulated constructions (Bolinger, 1976; Pawley and Syder, 1983). These insights began to be supported empirically as computer technology permitted the identification of recurrent phraseological patterns in very large corpora of spoken and written English using specialised software (e.g. Sinclair, 1991).  Phrasebank recognises that there is an important phraseological dimension to academic language and attempts to make examples of this explicit. Sources of the phrases The phrases in this resource have been taken from authentic academic sources.

In selecting a phrase for inclusion into the Academic Phrasebank, the following questions are asked: does it serve a useful communicative purpose in academic text? does it contain collocational and/or formulaic elements? are the content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives) generic in nature? does the combination ‘sound natural’ to a native speaker or writer of English? When is it acceptable to reuse phrases in academic writing? In a recent study (Davis and Morley, 2013), 45 academics from two British universities were surveyed to determine whether reusing phrases was a legitimate activity for academic writers, and if so, what kind of phrases could be reused.

Theoretical Influences

The Academic Phrasebank largely draws on an approach to analysing academic texts originally pioneered by John Swales in the 1980s. Utilising a genre analysis approach to identify rhetorical patterns in the introductions to research articles, Swales defined a ‘move’ as a section of text that serves a specific communicative function (Swales, 1981,1990).
