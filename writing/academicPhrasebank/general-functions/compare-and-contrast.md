## Introducing differences

- X is different from Y in a number of respects. X differs from Y in a number of important ways. There are a number of important differences between X and Y. Areas where significant differences have been found include X and Y. In contrast to earlier findings, however, no evidence of X was detected. A descriptive case study differs from an exploratory study in that it uses …
- Smith (2015) found dramatic differences in the rate of decline of X between Y and Z. Women and men differ not only in physical attributes but also in the way in which they …
- The nervous systems of Xs are significantly different from those of Ys in several key respects. Smith (2015) found observed clear minor major notable distinct only slight significant considerable differences between X and Y.

Introducing similarities Both X and Y share a number of key features. There are a number of similarities between X and Y. The effects of X on human health are similar to those of Y. Both X and Y generally take place in a ‘safe environment’. These results are similar to those reported by (Smith et al. 1999). This definition is similar to that found in (Smith, 2001) who writes: The return rate is similar to that of comparable studies (e.g. Smith et al. 1999). The approach used in this investigation is similar to that used by other researchers. Studies have compared Xs in humans and animals and found that they are essentially identical. The mode of processing used by the right brain is similar to that is comparable to that is comparable in complexity to that used by the left brain.

In contrast to oral communities, it is very difficult to get away from calendar time in literate societies. Compared with people in oral cultures, people in literate cultures organise their lives around clocks and calendars.
