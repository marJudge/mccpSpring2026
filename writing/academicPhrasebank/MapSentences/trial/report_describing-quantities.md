## 2. Similar sentences found in the paper

- BLOOM is a 176 billion parameter language model trained on 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages that was developed and released by a collaboration of hundreds of researchers.
- The compute for training BLOOM was provided through a French public grant from GENCI and IDRIS, leveraging IDRIS’ Jean Zay supercomputer.
- BLOOM was trained on the ROOTS corpus (Laurençon et al., 2022), a composite collection of 498 Hugging Face datasets (Lhoest et al., 2021) amounting to 1.61 terabytes of text that span 46 natural languages and 13 programming languages.
- Training BLOOM took about 3.5 months to complete and consumed 1,082,990 compute hours.
- We conducted validation experiments using 150k and 250k vocabulary sizes to make comparisons with existing multilingual modeling literature easier (Conneau et al., 2020; Xue et al., 2021).
- The ROOTS dataset contains around 341 billion tokens of text, so we aimed to train all models for the equivalent amount of tokens.
- Many authors appear under multiple categories because they contributed to the project in more than one way.
- lists individuals without whom BLOOM would not have happened and/or who spent more than 20% of their time on the BigScience effort as a whole.
- lists individuals who contributed to data sourcing, organization, and processing efforts, including the authors of Laurençon et al. (2022), McMillan-Major et al. (2022), and Jernite et al. (2022).
- lists individuals who built the BLOOM tokenizer and authors of Mielke et al. (2021).
- lists individuals who wrote, edited, and reviewed prompt templates for the datasets we consider as well as authors of Sanh et al. (2022), Bach et al. (2022), and Muennighoff et al. (2022b).
- lists individuals who ran experiments to help determine BLOOM’s model architecture and training objective, including authors of Wang et al. (2022a) and Le Scao et al. (2022).
- lists individuals who contributed to code and infrastructure to train BLOOM on the Jean Zay supercomputer.
- lists individuals who helped evaluate the BLOOM model as well as authors of Talat et al. (2022).
- lists authors of the ethical charter, license, and model card, in addition to individuals who studied privacy issues, social impacts, and BLOOM’s carbon footprint.
- lists members of working groups focused on applications of BLOOM, including authors of Fries et al. (2022b), Fries et al. (2022a), and De Toni et al. (2022).
- lists individuals who coordinated the BigScience effort and authors of Akiki et al. (2022).
