- This section discusses our design methodology and the architecture of X.
- In this section, we document the design of X, including Y, Z, and A.
- In this work, we present X, a Y-parameter open-access Z.
- In this paper, we chronicled the development of X, from Y to Z.
- We hope that the release of X unlocks new applications and research directions for Y.
- We hope that documenting our experience will help the community organize projects similar to X.
