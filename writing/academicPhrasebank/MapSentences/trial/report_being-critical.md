- However, the computational costs have also lead to concerns about the carbon footprint stemming from the training and use of large language models.
- The design decisions when training a tokenizer are often neglected in favour of 'default' settings (Mielke et al., 2021).
- A very high fertility on a language compared to a monolingual tokenizer may indicate a degradation on the downstream multilingual performance of the model (Rust et al., 2021).
- However, results are very poor between Swahili and Yoruba, languages that are present but under-represented in BLOOM’s training data (<<<50k tokens each). This contrasts with the results for translation between Romance (and therefore related) languages, where results are good across-the-board, including for translation from Galician (glg), a language not included in the training data, but which shares many similarities with the other Romance languages, in particular with Portuguese (por). This however does question BLOOM’s quality on those under-represented low-resource languages included in training.
