### Introducing differences

- X is different from Y in a number of respects. X differs from Y in a number of important ways. There are a number of important differences between X and Y. Areas where significant differences have been found include X and Y. In contrast to earlier findings, however, no evidence of X was detected. A descriptive case study differs from an exploratory study in that it uses …
- Smith (2015) found dramatic differences in the rate of decline of X between Y and Z. Women and men differ not only in physical attributes but also in the way in which they …
- The nervous systems of Xs are significantly different from those of Ys in several key respects. Smith (2015) found observed clear minor major notable distinct only slight significant considerable differences between X and Y.
- The nervous systems of Xs are significantly different from those of Ys in several key respects.

### Introducing similarities

- Both X and Y share a number of key features. There are a number of similarities between X and Y. The effects of X on human health are similar to those of Y. Both X and Y generally take place in a ‘safe environment’. These results are similar to those reported by (Smith et al. 1999). This definition is similar to that found in (Smith, 2001) who writes: The return rate is similar to that of comparable studies (e.g. Smith et al. 1999). The approach used in this investigation is similar to that used by other researchers. Studies have compared Xs in humans and animals and found that they are essentially identical. The mode of processing used by the right brain is similar to that is comparable to that is comparable in complexity to that used by the left brain.

### Comparing within one sentence

- Oral societies tend to be more concerned with the present whereas while literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past. Whereas While oral societies tend to be more concerned with the present, literate societies have a very definite awareness of the past. This interpretation differs from that contrasts with that is different from that of Smith and Jones (2004) who argue that …. In contrast to oral communities, it is very difficult to get away from calendar time in literate societies. Compared with people in oral cultures, people in literate cultures organise their lives around clocks and calendars.
- Women are more/less likely to suffer from X when the front part of the brain is damaged. The part of the brain connecting the two hemispheres may be more/less extensive in women.

### Comparing within one sentence: comparative forms

- In the trial, women made more/fewer errors than men. Women tend to have greater/less verbal fluency than men. Women are more/less likely than men to perform well in tests. Women are more/less accurate in tests of target-directed motor skills. Women tend to perform better/worse than men on tests of perceptual speed. Women are faster/slower than men at certain precision manual tasks, such as …
- Women are more/less likely to suffer from X when the front part of the brain is damaged. The part of the brain connecting the two hemispheres may be more/less extensive in women.
- Women are more/less likely to suffer from X when the front part of the brain is damaged. The part of the brain connecting the two hemispheres may be more/less extensive in women.

### Indicating difference across two sentences

- It is very difficult to get away from calendar time in literate societies. By contrast, In contrast, On the other hand, many people in oral communities have little idea of the calendar year of their birth.
- Smith (2015) argues that …
- Similarly, Likewise, In the same way, Jones (2019) asserts that …
- Jones (2019) holds the view that …

### Indicating similarity across two sentences

- Young children learning their first language need simplified input. Similarly, Likewise, In the same way, low level adult learners need graded input supplied in most cases by a teacher. Smith (2015) sees X as …

- On the other hand, many people in oral communities have little idea of the calendar year of their birth.
- While these capabilities have led to widespread adoption, most LLMs are developed by resource-rich organizations and are frequently kept from the public.
- However, subsequent work by Peters et al. (2018); Howard and Ruder (2018); Radford et al. (2018); Devlin et al. (2019) showed that the framework of Collobert et al. (2011), where the entire model is pretrained before being finetuned, can attain stronger performance.
- While the largest number of participants ultimately originated from the US, 38 countries were represented.
- However, results are very poor between Swahili and Yoruba, languages that are present but under-represented in BLOOM’s training data (<<<50k tokens each). This contrasts with the results for translation between Romance (and therefore related) languages, where results are good across-the-board, including for translation from Galician (glg), a language not included in the training data, but which shares many similarities with the other Romance languages, in particular with Portuguese (por). This however does question BLOOM’s quality on those under-represented low-resource languages included in training.
- BLOOM was trained using Megatron-DeepSpeed212121github.com/bigscience-workshop/Megatron-DeepSpeed (Smith et al., 2022), a framework for large-scale distributed training. It consists of two parts: Megatron-LM222222github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM (Shoeybi et al., 2019) provides the Transformer implementation, tensor parallelism, and data loading primitives, whereas DeepSpeed232323github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed (Rasley et al., 2020) provides the ZeRO optimizer, model pipelining, and general distributed training components. This framework allows us to train efficiently with 3D parallelism (Narayanan et al., 2021, shown in Figure 6), a fusion of three complementary approaches to distributed training.

## 4. New template extracted from the paper

- In contrast, X is kept from the public while Y has led to widespread adoption.
- While A leads to X, B shows a different trend.
- In contrast to earlier findings, Y demonstrated that X can attain stronger performance.
- While A is predominant in X, Y represents a wider diversity.
- However, results for X and Y are poor, which contrasts with results for language Z where results are good.
- X was trained using Y, a framework that includes Z and A, allowing for efficient training processes.
