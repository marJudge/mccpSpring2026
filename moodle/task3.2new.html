<p><strong>Deadline:</strong> <strong>15 February 2026</strong></p>

<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> This is a <strong>collection task</strong> - you're providing materials for analysis. The teacher will analyze your writing and provide personalized feedback. You don't need to do the analysis yourself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Read your writing sample and comments</li>
  <li>Analyze gaps by comparing your writing with assessment rubrics and model papers</li>
  <li>Consider your reflection and how you use AI</li>
  <li>Provide a diagnostic report on gaps identified and recommendations for improvement</li>
