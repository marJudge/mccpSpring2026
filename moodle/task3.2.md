In this course, you are expected to write about 1000 to 1500 words including an Introduction section and a literature review. You may find the instructions here https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/blob/main/writing/assessment/writing_instructions_formatted.md

I've developed a workflow to guide you to analyze model papers and gain actionable insights that may inform your writing for this task as well as for academic publication. You can find the workflow here https://tesolchina.github.io/mccpSpring2026/writing/assessment/workflow.html

here is a video walkthrough https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGUTcdiFOGY

Sample files can be found here https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/tree/main/writing/assessment

Your task is to follow the steps to analyze model papers and reply here with a GitHub file path to the analysis results similar to https://github.com/tesolchina/mccpSpring2026/blob/main/literature/GFY*/task_achievement_analysis.html

in your reply also write a few words discussing to what extent the analyses can inform your writing

I hope you can complete the writing task (first draft by the end of Feb); so it would be great if you can finish this task by  **15 Feb** . Note that the analyses can be done on a few files or more, e.g. 50-100 papers. Whether a larger scale analysis can reveal more insights depends on various factors- we need to review it case by case.
