        <section><h2>Abstract</h2><ul><li>A well-studied generalization of the standard online convex optimization (OCO) framework is constrained online convex optimization (COCO). In COCO, on every round, a convex cost function and a convex constraint function are revealed to the learner after it chooses the action for that round. The objective is to design an online learning policy that simultaneously achieves a small regret while ensuring a small cumulative constraint violation (CCV) against an adaptive adversary interacting over...</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>1 Introduction</h2><ul><li>Online convex optimization (OCO) is a standard framework for modelling and analyzing a broad family of online decision problems under uncertainty. In the OCO problem, on every round t t 𝑡 t italic_t , an online policy first selects an action x_{t} x t subscript 𝑥 𝑡 x_{t} italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT from a closed and convex admissible set ( a.k.a. decision set) \mathcal{X}. 𝒳 . 𝒳...</li><li>The term static refers to using a fixed benchmark, specifically only one action x^{\star} x ⋆ superscript 𝑥 ⋆ x^{\star} italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT throughout the horizon of length T T 𝑇 T italic_T .</li><li>In this paper, we consider a generalization of the standard OCO framework. In this problem, on every round t, t , 𝑡 t, italic_t , the online policy first chooses an admissible action x_{t}\in\mathcal{X}, x t ∈ 𝒳 , subscript 𝑥 𝑡 𝒳 x_{t}\in\mathcal{X}, italic_x start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_X , and then the adversary chooses a convex cost function f_{t}:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R} f t :...</li><li>Let \mathcal{X}^{\star} 𝒳 ⋆ superscript 𝒳 ⋆ \mathcal{X}^{\star} caligraphic_X start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT be the feasible set consisting of all admissible actions that satisfy all constraints g_{t,i}(x)\leq 0,\ i\in[k],t\in[T] g t , i ⁢ ( x ) ≤ 0 , i ∈ [ k ] , t ∈ [ T ] formulae-sequence subscript 𝑔 𝑡 𝑖 𝑥 0 formulae-sequence 𝑖 delimited-[] 𝑘 𝑡 delimited-[] 𝑇 g_{t,i}(x)\leq 0,\ i\in[k],t\in[T]...</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>2 The Constrained OCO (COCO) Problem</h2><ul><li>We now state the assumptions considered in this paper. These assumptions are standard in literature on the COCO problem ( guo2022online ; yi2021regret ; neely2017online ) .</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>3 The Online Constraint Satisfaction Problem ( OCS )</h2><ul><li>In this section, we study a special case of the COCO problem, which involves only constraint functions and no cost functions. The OCS problem arises in many practical settings, including the multi-task learning problem (see Section A.3 in the Appendix for a brief discussion). In Section A.8 in the Appendix, we also establish a connection between the OCS problem and the well-studied Convex Body Chasing problem (...</li><li>The objective is to design an online learning policy so that \mathbb{V}(T) 𝕍 ⁢ ( T ) 𝕍 𝑇 \mathbb{V}(T) blackboard_V ( italic_T ) is as small as possible. It is worth noting that in the OCS problem, we consider a soft constraint violation metric \max_{\mathcal{I}}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{I}}g_{t,i}(x_{t}) max ℐ ⁢ ∑ t ∈ ℐ g t , i ⁢ ( x t ) subscript ℐ subscript 𝑡 ℐ subscript 𝑔 𝑡 𝑖 subscript 𝑥 𝑡...</li><li>Here, we assume that there is an admissible action x^{\star}\in\mathcal{X} x ⋆ ∈ 𝒳 superscript 𝑥 ⋆ 𝒳 x^{\star}\in\mathcal{X} italic_x start_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ⋆ end_POSTSUPERSCRIPT ∈ caligraphic_X that satisfies the aggregate constraints over any interval of S S 𝑆 S italic_S rounds. However, unlike georgios-cautious , which also considers the same assumption, the value of the parameter S S 𝑆 S italic_S is not...</li><li>We now replace Assumption 3 with the following weaker version:</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>4 Experiments: Credit Card Fraud Detection</h2><ul><li>We first formulate the credit card fraud detection problem in the COCO framework. Assume that we receive a sequence of d d 𝑑 d italic_d -dimensional feature vectors \{z_{t}\}_{t\geq 1} { z t } t ≥ 1 subscript subscript 𝑧 𝑡 𝑡 1 \{z_{t}\}_{t\geq 1} { italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT } start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t ≥ 1 end_POSTSUBSCRIPT and the corresponding binary labels \{y_{t}\}_{t\geq 1} {...</li><li>Let \hat{y}_{t}(z_{t},x) y ^ t ⁢ ( z t , x ) subscript ^ 𝑦 𝑡 subscript 𝑧 𝑡 𝑥 \hat{y}_{t}(z_{t},x) over^ start_ARG italic_y end_ARG start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT ( italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , italic_x ) be the likelihood of class 1 1 1 1 1 for the feature z_{t}, z t , subscript 𝑧 𝑡 z_{t}, italic_z start_POSTSUBSCRIPT italic_t end_POSTSUBSCRIPT , given by a...</li><li>We train the model by maximizing the sum of log-likelihoods for legitimate transactions, subject to the constraint that all fraudulent transactions have a likelihood value close to 1 1 1 1 1 ( i.e., the sum of the log-likelihoods of the fraudulent transactions remains close to zero):</li><li>The above problem ( 23 ) can be immediately recognized to be an instance of COCO with the following cost and constraint functions:</li></ul></section>
        <section><h2>5 Conclusion</h2><ul><li>In this paper, we proposed efficient online policies for the COCO problem with optimal performance bounds. We also derived sublinear CCV bounds for the OCS problem under a set of relaxed assumptions. Our analysis is streamlined, leveraging Lyapunov theory and adaptive regret bounds for the standard OCO problem. In the future, exploring dynamic regret bounds and a bandit extension of the COCO problem would be...</li></ul></section>
