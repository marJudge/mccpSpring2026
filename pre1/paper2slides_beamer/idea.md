here are two tools 
https://github.com/HKUDS/Paper2Slides 
beamer

we'd like to explore PhDagentSpring2026/literature/WYQ*/extracted_2412 using this paper as an example 

create a sub-folder trial
add the paper to this folder
then create p2splan.md and beamerPlan.md to describe how these two tools can be used to create slides 
what input from human user is necessary
