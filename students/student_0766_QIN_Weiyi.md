## Workflow

**Workflow 1: Formula validation and research expansion**
- **Input:** Original research idea and manually derived formulas.
- **Process:** 
  1. **Validation:** Use AI to double-check my derivation for logic or math errors.
  2. **Stress Test:** Prompt AI to test the formula under extreme/edge cases.
  3. **Brainstorm:** Ask AI for divergent applications or theoretical extensions.
- **Output:** A verified model with expanded research possibilities.

**Workflow 2: Draft refinement**
- **Input:** A rough draft or specific paragraphs that need refinement.
- **Process:** 
  1. **Initial Polish:** Inputting the draft into AI for structural and stylistic optimization.
  2. **Human Intervention:** Reviewing the AI output to fix inconsistent terminology or tone mismatches.
  3. **Secondary Refinement:** Re-feeding the corrected text back into AI for a final polish to ensure seamless flow.
- **Output:** A high-quality, polished text that maintains consistent terminology and academic tone.

## AI Wishlist

I wish AI could maintain better terminology consistency during long-term writing projects, ensuring that key terms and styles remain uniform throughout the entire document without manual correction.
